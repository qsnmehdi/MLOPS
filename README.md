# MLOPS: Binary classification of auction players

This project presents a complete MLOps solution for binary classification of auction players. It is an application that uses machine learning models to predict whether an auction player is likely to win or lose an auction based on a set of characteristics. The project encompasses model design, training, validation, and deployment of a RESTful API for real-time use.

This project entails conducting exploratory data analysis and selecting appropriate models. The deployment of the chosen model is executed utilizing FastAPI and Docker.

Post-deployment monitoring of the model is accomplished through Prometheus.
