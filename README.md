# MLOPS: Binary classification of auction players

This project presents a complete MLOps solution for binary classification of auction players. It is an application that uses machine learning models to predict whether an auction player is likely to win or lose an auction based on a set of characteristics. The project encompasses model design, training, validation, and deployment of a RESTful API for real-time use.

## Installation
