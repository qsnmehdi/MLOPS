# MLOPS: Binary classification of auction players

This project presents a complete MLOps solution for binary classification of auction players. It is an application that uses machine learning models to predict whether an auction player is likely to win or lose an auction based on a set of characteristics. The project encompasses model design, training, validation, and deployment of a RESTful API for real-time use.

## Installation

There are only two prerequisites:

 - Docker
 
 - Docker-compose

Having both, you'll need to clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/qsnmehdi/MLOPS
```



##Usage

```bash
docker-compose up

Now you have access to those three containers and their respective ports:

Prometheus: http://localhost:9090/
Grafana: http://localhost:3000/
FastAPI: http://localhost:8000/
